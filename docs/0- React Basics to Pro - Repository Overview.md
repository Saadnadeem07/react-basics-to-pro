# React Basics to Pro - Repository Overview

## Purpose
This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for React development, covering fundamental concepts through advanced patterns. It's designed to take developers from basic React understanding to professional-level proficiency through practical examples and detailed documentation.

## What's Covered

### Core Concepts
- **React Fundamentals**: Understanding why React exists, how React applications flow, and the underlying architecture
- **Components & Props**: Building reusable UI components and passing data between them using props with multiple practical examples
- **State Management**: Managing component state using useState hook with event handling and interactive examples

### React Hooks
- **useState**: Interactive state management with click events and dynamic UI updates
- **useEffect**: Side effects, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations
- **useRef**: DOM manipulation and persistent values without re-renders
- **useReducer**: Complex state logic management with reducer patterns for objects and arrays
- **useMemo**: Performance optimization through memoization of expensive calculations
- **useCallback**: Preventing unnecessary re-renders by memoizing callback functions
- **useId**: Generating unique IDs for accessibility and form elements
- **useLayoutEffect**: Synchronous DOM mutations before browser paint
- **useTransition**: Managing UI transitions for better user experience with deferred updates
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable logic by building custom React hooks

### Advanced Patterns
- **Context API vs Props Drilling**: Solving prop drilling problems with Context API, demonstrated through a multi-generational component hierarchy (GreatGrandfather → Grandfather → Father → Son)
- **Data Fetching**: API integration and handling asynchronous data
- **Array Methods**: Practical use of map() and filter() functions for rendering dynamic lists and filtering data
- **Form Handling**: Managing form inputs, validation, and submission with multiple approaches

### Practical Application
- **Password Manager Mini Project**: A complete mini-project demonstrating real-world application of React concepts
