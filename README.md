# React + Vite

# ⚛️ React Basics

This repository is created to **practice and master core React concepts** — from components, props, and state, to hooks, events, and data flow between components.

Each concept is organized in its own folder inside `/src/components`, with code examples and explanations in individual `README.md` files.

### 🧠 Topics Covered

- `useState` — managing component state
- `props` — parent ↔ child communication
- `useEffect` — handling side effects
- `useRef` — working with DOM references
- `context` — global state management
- and more...

### 🚀 Purpose

To build a **strong foundation in React** through hands-on coding and documentation — preparing for real-world projects and interviews.
