# React + Vite

# ⚛️ React Basics

This repository is created to **practice and master core React concepts** — from components, props, and state, to hooks, events, and data flow between components.

Each concept is organized in its own folder inside `/src/components`, with code examples and explanations in individual `README.md` files.
